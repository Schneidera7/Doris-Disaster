Project 2 
Alban Schneider 
3-23-17

To use this project, start by calling the makefile on all of the files. Once done the tester contains
instructions on how to use the interface. 
This code allows the user to add people to the registered and remove them. Also it can search for a last name
and return a count for the tree. 

I was attempting C level though it does have some bugs. 
The nodes are in their own class and the code implements a binary tree, with at least 4 of the 5 meathods.

I looked at this project all wrong, I was working on all the levels at the same time. I stripped my code and started on the D-Level. D-Level was working by end of this.

Worked on C-Level and once done, realized errors in D-Level when the Nodes become their own class. How do I keep private?

Saw MG for office hours and got the Node methods and variables all set up. Then got working on thee methods for the tester to work. Also at this point the BTree still cant add names or anything.

I feel like I am going in circles. I have tried many different methods but I cant get the tree to work.

Worked with MG in office hours helped to get the insert and search working. Now the code compiles and does achieve D level and witht the nodes in their own class its at C-Level.

Sought more help on project. Still no progress past adding names, searching, removing, and repeating the count. I tried to get first names but took it out to keep a working code. Turned in today and used my last two days of free.
