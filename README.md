To use this project, start by calling the makefile on all of the files. Once done the tester contains
instructions on how to use the interface. 
This code allows the user to add people to the registered and remove them. Also it can search for a last name
and return a count for the tree. 

I was attempting C level though it does have some bugs. 
The nodes are in their own class and the code implements a binary tree, with at least 4 of the 5 meathods.
